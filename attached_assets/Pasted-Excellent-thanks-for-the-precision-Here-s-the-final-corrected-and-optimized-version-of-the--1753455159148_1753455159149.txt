Excellent — thanks for the precision. Here's the **final, corrected, and optimized version** of the application generator prompt that **includes pushing risks to JIRA** (e.g., as a task, bug, or risk-type issue). This version preserves all the previously defined functionality, structure, and test/live dual-mode capability — and updates **Risk Management** to include:

* **Optional push of risks to JIRA**
* **JIRA status sync back to the TPM app**
* **Ability to configure risk mapping to custom issue types in JIRA**

# ✅ Final Application Generator Prompt: **TPM Automation App (Dual Mode + JIRA Risk Sync)**

> Build an enterprise-grade **web application** that automates the responsibilities of a **Technical Program Manager (TPM)** for large-scale engineering programs (e.g., UKG’s New-Flex Authz and legacy-HCM Security). The app should support the entire lifecycle of technical program delivery with full automation, visibility, and governance.
>
> The application must operate in **two modes**:

## 🔄 Dual Mode Functionality

### 1. **Test Mode**

* Fully interactive, preloaded with **realistic mock data** (projects, milestones, risks, escalations, dependencies)
* Simulated integrations:

  * **Fake JIRA**, **Smartsheet**, **Confluence**, **Slack**, **Teams**
* Auto-generated **test dashboards, risk heatmaps, escalations, reports**
* **Testing checklist** interface for validating module-by-module functionality
* **Scenario simulator** for testing risk escalation or milestone delay impacts
* Immediate deployability, no setup required

### 2. **Live Mode**

* Connects to real tools via secure integration:

  * JIRA (for milestones + risks)
  * Smartsheet
  * Confluence
  * Slack and Teams
* **Onboarding wizard** for each integration: enter credentials, test connection, map issue types
* Supports role-based permissions, OAuth2, SSO, audit trails
* Secure config management for API tokens and webhooks

## 🧩 Functional Modules

### 1. **Program & Project Planning**

* Create/manage programs with OKRs and KPIs
* Roadmap builder with drag-and-drop interface
* Document templates: kickoff decks, status reports, rollout plans

### 2. **Milestone Management**

* Create milestones and link to objectives
* Option to **push milestones to JIRA** as Business Epics or Epics
* Pull and display JIRA status updates
* Show visual timeline, critical path, and milestone owners

### 3. **Risk Management**

* Add risks with attributes: type, severity, owner, due date, mitigation plan
* Visual **risk heatmaps**, AI-predicted risk scores
* **Option to push risks to JIRA**:

  * Allow user to choose mapping (e.g., Task, Bug, Risk)
  * Include description, tags, priority, and links to mitigation actions
* **Bidirectional sync**: updates in JIRA reflect back into the app
* Filter view by JIRA-linked vs internal-only risks

### 4. **Dependency Tracking**

* Track cross-team dependencies
* Display upstream/downstream relationships
* Alert if risk status changes for related items
* Visualize using interactive graphs (MermaidJS / D3)

### 5. **Adopter Support**

* Track internal feature/API adopters
* Score onboarding status, support needs, and timelines
* Adopter-specific dashboards
* Feedback summaries and exportable readiness scorecards

### 6. **Escalation Workflow**

* Structured form to capture escalations (summary, urgency, owner, impact, etc.)
* Output options:

  * Send to **Slack or Teams** (formatted block message)
  * Send via **email**
  * Export to **PDF** or **Word**
* Escalations remain **external to JIRA**

### 7. **Executive Reporting**

* Auto-generate weekly, monthly, quarterly status reports
* Shareable dashboards for program health, risk profile, and roadmap views
* Export data views and tables to **Smartsheet** and **Confluence**
* Schedule auto-distribution via Slack/Teams/email

### 8. **AI/NLP Enhancements**

* Summarize planning docs, meetings, and escalations using GPT-4o or Claude 3
* Extract action items from notes or pasted text
* Predict milestone delays or risk escalations
* Scenario simulation with AI commentary on likely outcomes and suggestions
